# Exploring Trip Length of Different User Types Using Toronto Bikeshare Ridership Data

Due to the transport flexibility, reductions to vehicle emissions, health benefits, reduced congestion and fuel consumption, and financial savings for individuals, more and more people in Toronto choose to use share bike to go round the city. Just in last month, January 2020, 11.25M in Funding is proposed to boost Toronto's bike share program. 

In this report, I wanted to further investigate the difference in behavior of user type member and casual, and mainly focus on the relationship between trip length and user types. And this can further explain how different user types are using Bike Share, and reveals the main purpose of using share bikes for member and casual users.

And I mainly used Python for this report, including the pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, fuzzywuzzy, geopy.
